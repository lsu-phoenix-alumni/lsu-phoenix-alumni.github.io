The LSU Fighting Tigers will face the Missouri Tigers in Columbia, MO. The game was originally scheduled to be played in Baton Rouge, but Hurricane Delta has forced a change to the venue.  Due to the early start time, the Phoenix Alumni group will not be meeting at our usual gathering spot.  
<br>
Game time is 9:00am MST.
