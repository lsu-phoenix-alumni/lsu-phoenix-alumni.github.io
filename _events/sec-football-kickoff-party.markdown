The Florida Gators alumni club are hosting the annual football kickoff party on  Saturday August 3rd noon to 3pm at Buffalo Wild Wings on Indian Bend Road. We'd love to see LSU represented at this event. Wear your colors, bring your pom-poms and let's out-yell those other groups! 

Buffalo Wild Wings is located at 8870 E Indian Bend Road in Scottsdale (near Pima, just west of the 101). 

Geaux Tigers!
