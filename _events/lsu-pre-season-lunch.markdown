Get familiar with RT O'Sullivans before the season starts. Check out the space, peruse the menu, and say hi to some old friends. All fans are invited to a pre season lunch at the new home for LSU football on Saturday August 17th at 11:30am. RT O'Sullivans is located on the Southeast corner of Hayden and Thomas Roads. There's plenty of parking, a lovely patio and sand volleyball!
