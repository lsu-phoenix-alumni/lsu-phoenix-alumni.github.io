  <p class="lh-copy mb4">The Phoenix Chapter of the LSU Alumni Association strives to keep its alumni and fans connected.</p>

  <ul class="lh-copy mb4 pl1">
    <li>Our Board has a direct line of contact the LSU Alumni Association headquarters in Baton Rouge and is able to bring the latest in LSU news and information.</li>
    <li>Our chapter communicates via email, e-newsletters, website and/or flyers on average once a month.</li>
    <li>Our chapter members come from everywhere and range in age from young to old. We have fresh college graduates, 20- and 30-somethings, Baby Boomers and more. We have doctors, lawyers, architects, business owners, students, nurses, teachers… you name it, and we got it!</li>
    <li>We host no less than a dozen activities a year – most of which are free to LSU alumni and fans.</li>
    <li>Our chapter certainly gathers for most every major LSU sporting event, but we also meet socially for crawfish boils, wine tastings, BBQs, Diamondbacks games, and more!</li>
    <li>And finally, in addition to all the fun and games, our chapter has our own scholarship program -- the Joel Monte West Club Scholarship -- which funds an Arizona high school student when they attend LSU.</li>
  </ul>
