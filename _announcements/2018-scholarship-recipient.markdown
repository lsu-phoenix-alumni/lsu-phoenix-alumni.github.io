Did you know, every fall, LSU Alumni Phoenix provides a $500 scholarship to one student from Arizona enrolled as a freshman at LSU? This year's recipient is Kelli Agnew from Sandra Day O'Connor High School. Kelli is a member of the LSU Beach Volleyball team and has wanted to play at LSU since visiting in 2016. These scholarships are made possible by our members annual dues and participation in our fundraising opportunities. Thank you for making this scholarship possible!  
 
From Kelli: Hello LSU Phoenix, I wanted to thank you so much for the generous scholarship I received from the alumni. I am so grateful to have received this money and to be going to LSU and representing Phoenix! Thank you and Geaux Tigers! - Kelli
