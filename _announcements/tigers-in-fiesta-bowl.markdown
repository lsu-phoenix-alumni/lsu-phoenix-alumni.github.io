Did y'all see this story last Saturday's Morning Advocate? There is a chance the Tigers could be headed to Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl! Official announcements won't come until December 2nd but that doesn't mean we haven't started planning. We are working with LSU Alumni in Baton Rouge to secure a block of tickets with the Traveling Tigers group. If you know you want to purchase tickets in this block, please let **Tracee** (email: nolagirl@hotmail.com) know how many you'd like. No word on pricing at this time, but we do need to be ready to say how many we want once the game is secured. We'll announce all the details as soon as we have them!
