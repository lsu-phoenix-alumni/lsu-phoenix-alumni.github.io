We are still looking for individuals who are interested in joining the LSU Phoenix board of directors as well as folks to help out at upcoming events. Don't be afraid of commitment.  Prior experience is not necessary. Just a love of all things LSU and a desire to tell everyone about it! If you would like to help out in any way, please reach out to Tracee.
