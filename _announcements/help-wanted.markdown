The LSU Phoenix Alumni group is looking for individuals interested in joining our board of directors, as well as folks to help out at upcoming events. Don't be afraid of commitment.  Prior experience is not necessary. Just a love of all things LSU and a desire to tell everyone about it! If you would like to help out in any way, please reach out to Tracee.
