**What? No Bama Game???**  

For the first time since 1964, LSU and Alabama will not take on each other during the regular season. Sure the game is "postponed" but if you look at the schedule, it's unlikely this matchup can be accommodated without major revisions. Chalk it up to 2020 and Coronavirus.

In the meantime, our love for LSU doesn't end. Being an LSU Fan you not only bleed purple and gold, you back your team, your school, in good times and bad. This is a rough year. There's been a lot of loss, not just on the field but all around us. Let's join together and support each other, The Tigers and LSU.

Let's also support our friends at **RT O'Sullivans**. They are open for patio dining as well as take out. They offer beer, wine and hard seltzer to go. Text "RTO" to 33733 to be directed to the pickup menu.

Until we meet again, stay safe and keep smiling!
