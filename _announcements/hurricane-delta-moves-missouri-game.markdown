Hurricane Delta has moved the Missouri game from Tiger Stadium to Columbia, MO. Kickoff will be at 9am Arizona time. At this moment, broadcast information hasn't been determined. Due to the early start and the lack of broadcast information, LSU Phoenix will not be hosting a game watch for this game. Please join us on October 17th at 12:30 for brunch at RTO's during the game against the Florida Gators.

In the meantime, we'll be hoping Delta loses strength and the damage is minimal.

GEAUX TIGERS!!
