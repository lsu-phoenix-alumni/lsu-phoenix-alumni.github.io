Time is running out to donate those extra cans and boxes of food to our SEC food drive. All donations collected from SEC clubs in Phoenix will be donated to the St Vincent de Paul food pantry. Let's show the rest of the SEC how giving LSU fans can be. Grab a couple of cans from the pantry and bring them out to the watch parties at **RT O'Sullivans.**
