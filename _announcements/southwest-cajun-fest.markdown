Southwest Cajun Fest will take place ten days before Mardi Gras on February 15th at AJ Chandler Park in Chandler. The event starts at noon and lasts until 9pm. Tickets are $8 in advance for general admission and $45 for the Big Easy Lounge VIP area. LSU Alumni Phoenix will be set up near the stage. If you'd like to volunteer in our booth, email [Tracee][1]. Looking forward to seeing lots of Tiger fans there!
