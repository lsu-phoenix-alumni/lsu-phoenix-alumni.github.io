**Geaux Tigers!!**
 
Saturday Night in Baton Rouge. Is there anything more perfect for this matchup?  
 
LSU Alumni Phoenix will be hosting the watch party of the season (so far) at Old Town Gringos. Festivities begin at 4pm Saturday - Kickoff is at 5pm.   
 
We have a great event planned for everyone complete with raffles, Big Al the Pinata and OTG game day specials! All funds from raffles will go towards LSU scholarships for local students. 
 
We could still use a couple of extra hands to help out with all the fun. If you can get there early to help decorate or sell raffle tickets, please contact Tracee (602.326.0229).
