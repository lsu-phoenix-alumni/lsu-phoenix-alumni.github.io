It's the end of the regular season, time to face the Aggies and the 12th Man. Vegas is calling us an "underdog" but we know that just drives our team to fight harder.   
 
This will be the 57th meeting between these two teams. The first game took place 119 years ago and the Tigers were defeated 52 - 0. Guess 1899 was a rough year for our squad.   
 
LSU Alumni Phoenix will be hosting the watch party at our Arizona home **Old Town Gringos**. Kickoff is at 5:30 here in Arizona. Skip the holiday leftovers and enjoy fresh chips and salsa with us!  

**Geaux Tigers!**
