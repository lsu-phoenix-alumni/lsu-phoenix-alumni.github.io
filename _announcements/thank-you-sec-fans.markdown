SEC Alumni groups in Phoenix collected over 2500 pounds of food for the St. Vincent de Paul food bank! Mizzou took the lead with over 1100 pounds! As you can see, LSU had the smallest contribution with only 38 pounds. Let's set a goal for 2020 to make a greater contribution to this local challenge.
