Every spring, LSU students gather together to give back to their community. This year local alumni chapters are getting in on the action. LSU Phoenix will be volunteering in the gardens at [**Tovrea Castle**][1] in Phoenix on Friday April 3rd from 8-11am. This is a great opportunity to see the castle grounds up close and learn the history of the gardens. Tasks will involve weeding, planting and cleaning up the grounds. If you would like to participate in this community project, please contact [**Tracee**][2] with the number of volunteers spots needed.
