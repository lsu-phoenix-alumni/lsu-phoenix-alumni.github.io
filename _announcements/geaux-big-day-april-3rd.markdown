We still have space available for our group volunteer activity at Tovrea Castle. If you are available Friday April 3rd from 8-11 am and would like to be part of our cleanup of the grounds and gardens, please let [**Tracee**][2] know so she can get you on the list.  
<br> 
This event is part of the Geaux Big initiative started at LSU to promote giving back to your community. This year local alumni chapters across the country are getting in on the action.  
<br>
If you would like to participate in this community project, please contact [**Tracee**][2] with the number of volunteers spots needed.
