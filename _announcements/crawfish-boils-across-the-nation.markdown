Alumni chapters around the country are getting ready for annual crawfish boils. LSU San Diego will be holding its 32nd annual boil on Memorial Day weekend. What better time to escape the heat of Phoenix? Several chapter members have expressed interest in attending this event. David and Tracee will be out there this year so if you'd like to join them, go [**here**][1] for tickets and info!  
<br>
As for the often asked question, "When will we have a boil in Phoenix?" - efforts are taking place to make that happen. However, we can't do it alone. We need volunteers to join the board, to help organize and host events, to help with the logistics of event planning. If you'd like to volunteer your talents to LSU Alumni Phoenix, contact [**Tracee**][2]. I look forward to hearing from you soon! Geaux Tigers!
