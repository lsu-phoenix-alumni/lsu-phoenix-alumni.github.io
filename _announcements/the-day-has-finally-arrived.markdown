Remember that childhood chant "We're Number One, you're number two..."  That's been running through my mind for a week now! It feels good to be on top but we all know the importance of this game on Saturday. Is this the year we can shake that monkey off our back? My nerves are wrought already!  
<br>
Kickoff is at 1:30 and we are expecting a full capacity crowd at RT O'Sullivans. Get there early to secure your table. If you've got room to share, make room for new friends. They have added TVs to the back patio area and will have the game sound on throughout the entire restaurant. It's gonna be a party! LSU Phoenix Alumni will be there early with raffles and LSU merchandise for sale. Can't wait to see everyone there!
