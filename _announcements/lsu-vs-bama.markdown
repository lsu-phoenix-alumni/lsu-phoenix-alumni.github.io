The undefeated Crimson Tide roll into Tiger Stadium this weekend for a game rescheduled from November 14th. The 3 - 4 Tigers will be without wide receiver Terrace Marshall who has opted out of the remainder of the season. We all know there is no love lost for Saban and his team. Let's just hope we keep our heads up and score some points. Kickoff is at 6pm Arizona time. Bring your friends (except for that one Bama fan) out to the patio at **RT O'Sullivans** in Scottsdale. Please RSVP to Tracee if you plan to attend so the restaurant can staff accordingly.
