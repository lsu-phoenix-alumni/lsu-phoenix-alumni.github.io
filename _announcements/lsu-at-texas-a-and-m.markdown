Happy Thanksgiving Week Tiger Fans! The team is traveling to College Station this weekend to take on the Aggie's. Kickoff is at 5pm Arizona time. It's a holiday weekend so if you've got friends in town take them out to the patio at **RT O'Sullivans** in Scottsdale. Please RSVP to Tracee if you plan to attend so the restaurant can staff accordingly. Be safe and have a wonderful holiday!
